== Description ==
Tip Jar WP is made for creators, artists, teachers, service providers, and more. It gives an extremely simple and affordable way to accept tips on your WordPress website. On the cutting edge of payment technologies through the power of Stripe, you can accept Apple Pay, Google Pay, standard credit cards, and more with a beautiful and responsively designed payment form.

If you have supporters that love what you do, many will be happy to send a tip to say "thanks" if you give them the option to do so. With out-of-the-box features including both automatic-recurring-payments, or one-time tips, Tip Jar WP makes that possible.

It's totally free to install. Give it a try today!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. Does this include the Stripe integration for free?
Yes. Stripe is the payment gateway that works with Tip Jar WP, and it is included for free.

2. Are there any up-sells or extensions?
No. Everything you will need to accept single and recurring tips is included in Tip Jar WP for free.

3. Do I need an SSL certificate in order to use this?
Yes. Most webhosts are now able to set this up for you at no extra cost. Ask them about "LetsEncrypt".

4. Is this plugin free to use?
Tip Jar WP is totally free to install. There is a 1% transaction fee (plus Stripe fees). So we (Tip Jar WP) don't make money until you do. That means we have your best interests in mind at all times; we aren't successful unless you are.

5. What about GDPR Compliance?
This plugin stores absolutely no personally identifiable information about your users when they make a payment. No names, credit card information, IP addresses, nothing. Only emails are stored in WordPress core's "users" table, and can be erased using WordPress's normal erase-personal-data process. We recommend adding a note to your privacy policy stating that the only information recorded during a payment is the email address, and that all other data is handled by Stripe.com.
